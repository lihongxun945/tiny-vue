## What is this?

[中文版文档](./README.cn.md)

There is several detailed articles show how to write tiny-vue (in Chinese) [Diving into Vue1.0 source code](https://github.com/lihongxun945/myblog/labels/vue1.0%E6%BA%90%E7%A0%81%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90)

A dead simple implement of vuejs, use to learn the source code of vuejs (v1.0.28).
Vuejs source code is very elegant, but it's difficult for beginner to understand. You can try to learn this project, it will be very helpful to understand vuejs.
Most of lifecycle, modular and function name is same to vuejs, but all the code is rewrited (except `dep.js` and very few function implements)

There are two main part:

1. state: reactive state, listen to state's change, State -> Observer -> Dep -> Watcher
2. directive: support directive, you can add your own directives: Compile -> Directive -> directives

You can use it ike this:

```
<div id="a">
	<input v-model="message" />
	<button v-on:click="increase">Increase</button>
	<p v-text="message"></p>
</div>
<script>
	new Vue({
		el: "#a",
		data: {
			message: 1
		},
		methods: {
			increase () {
				this.message += 1
			}
		}
	})
</script>
```

## Supported Features
